## Examples

- Scripts and notebooks to regenerate the figures from Meisburger & Ando, Acta Cryst. D (2024): [examples/insulin-multi-crystal](examples/insulin-multi-crystal).

## Versions

### Version 1.0.4

- Added `mdx2.report` to automatically generate and execute ipython notebook reports from the command-line. Available templates: `visualization`, `scaling_model`, and `map_statistics`. For example outputs, see: [examples/insulin-multi-crystal/reports](examples/insulin-multi-crystal/reports) and [examples/insulin-tutorial/reports](examples/insulin-tutorial/reports).

### Version 1.0.3

- Performance boost for `mdx2.import_data` using parallel read and write. The `data.nxs` file contains a virtual dataset linking to neXus files in a subdirectory (`datastore/` by default).
- `mdx2.reintegrate` -- New command-line tool to create fine maps after scaling (single-sweep only: multi-crystal datasets not yet implemented)
- Optional pre-scaling in `mdx2.scale` to correct anisotropic background
- Improved handling of command-line arguments via `dataclass` attributes and `simple-parsing` package
- Updated examples

### Version 1.0.2

- Rudimentary Bragg peak integration, in development
- Support for non-reference space group settings
- Bug fixes, including:
  - Symmetry operators now rotate in the correct direction
  - Gracefully skip missing or masked data chunks

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You'll need package manager for conda environments. If you don't have one already, we recommend installing [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), which includes conda and mamba commands, and has the conda-forge channel as its default. If you use a different manager, you'll need to add the flag `-c conda-forge`.

### User install (miniforge)

Minimal install:

```bash
mamba create -n mdx2
mamba activate mdx2
mamba install mdx2
```

Recommended: add packages for Bragg processing, jupyter notebooks, and nexus visualization

```bash
mamba install jupyterlab dials xia2 nexpy
```

## Contributing

Mdx2 is being developed in collaboration with [The Diffuse Project](https://diffuse.science), and the `dev` branch in the org's fork contains the latest changes: [diff-use/mdx2/tree/dev](https://github.com/diff-use/mdx2/tree/dev).

Contributions can be made by branching from `dev`, and submitting PRs to that branch. When it is time for a new release, the `dev` branch is merged upstream to the `ando-lab/mdx2` repo.

### Developer install (conda + pip from dev branch of diff-use fork)

```bash
git clone -b dev https://github.com/diff-use/mdx2.git
cd mdx2
mamba create -f env.yaml -n mdx2-dev
mamba activate mdx2-dev
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The last line installs mdx2 in editable mode, with optional development tools including pytest and ruff.
